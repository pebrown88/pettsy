%%%info Leloup-Goldbeter mammalian model
% =====================================
% This sets the default end time for a signallng system
tend
100.000000
% =====================================
% This tells which ode solver method to use by default. Typical ones are ode45 and ode15s
method
matlab_non-stiff
% =====================================
This is the force type used from the file /shared/get_force_expr
force_type
photo
% =====================================
The period of an oscillating force
cycle_period
24
% =====================================
% This tells whether to treat all variables as non-negative or not. Options are non-negative and allow_negative
positivity
non-negative
% =====================================
Options are oscillator and signal. This tells us whether the solution should be periodic or not
orbit_type
oscillator
% =====================================
This is scaling factor for time i.e. if computation is in mins and the plot in hours then plotting_timescale = 60: tnew = t/plotting_timescale
plotting_timescale
1
% =====================================
The number of dimensions the model has
dim
16
% =====================================
The number of parameters, including dawn, dusk and amp
pnum
56
% =====================================
Possible force_types, those that were defined when make() was run on this model. The gui allows the user to select one of these

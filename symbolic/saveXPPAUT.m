%
% creates the file 'name'.eqn with the model's ODE for XPPAUT

% mdir is the directory where the file will be created
% rhs is the right hand side of the model
% varnames are the varaible names. If name.varn found in defs dir, then
% they are read from here. If not, they are read from name.varn in mdir, unless 
% we are overwriting this with the defaults. 
% If this file is not found, then they will be defaults y1, y2 etc ...
% 
% This function just saves symbolic equations. These used to create ode
% file for xppaut at runtime

function [fname, ftype, force, df, df2, df3] = get_force_expr(ft) 

%returns a series of force equations and their derivatives with respect to
%dawn and dusk

%ft is an integer
%force is the force equation
%ftype = 1 - force is constant, 0 - force is varying
%df(1) is dforce/ddawn, and df(2)is dforce/ddusk
%df2(1) is d2force/ddawn2 and df(2) is d2force/ddusk2
%df3(1) is (dforce/ddusk)/ddawn and df3(2) is (dforce/ddawn)/ddusk

%name is a descriptive name of the force type

%IMPORTANT
%Force expression can contain only the symbolic variables dawn, dusk, CP and t1,
%and any constants needed.

%force definition must not contain any y values or we can't correctly
%differentiate (dy/dp)/dy in file savedxb.m. ie dy/dp contains the symbolic expression
%dforce_ddawn. This is then differentiated with respect to y. This will give
%incorrect results if the symbolic expression includes y as the code won't
%know this when the model is made.
%So when dforce_ddawn is filled in at run time, it must not contain y(n).
%Instead put y(n) in the model equations if it should affect force
%Also, model jacobian would be calculated wrongly. The model equations
%contain the symbolic name 'force'. When they are differentiated with
%respect to y, if 'force' included y, this would give incorrect results

%Force must not contain any model parameters except dawn and dusk. This is
%becuase if it did, an the dpar matrix would not be calculated correctly.
%Here we are differentiating equation containing the symbolic name 'force'
%with respect to parameters, so force musn't contain any of these
%parameters as the code cannot know it does when the model is made.   

%if not, should be no cp either, ie dont use it for some other purpose

%called from writeforce and savexpp, launchxpp and make

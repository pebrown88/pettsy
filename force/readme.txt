If a function, it must be a continuous function whose second derivative exists at all time points over which the simulation will be run.</p> <p>The force expression can consist of literal values, MATLAB functions such as <code>sin()</code> and <code>exp()</code> and the following symbolic names only.</p><ul><li><code>dawn</code><li><code>dusk</code> <li><code>CP</code> (cycle period) <li><code>t</code> (time)</ul><p>It must not contain any other model parameters or model variables, or the model derivatives will not be calculated correctly.</p> <p>It is very important for oscillator models that PeTTSy is able to determine whether a force is constant or varying. Such a model run with a varying force (which will be repeated with an interval equal to the cycle period) is considered to be a forced oscillator, and if run with a constant force, is considered to be an unforced oscillator. The force expression will be examined to determine if it is a function of time, ie it includes the variable <code>t</code>. A force which is not a function of time is considered to be constant. It is important that this is accurate so please bear this in mind when creating your own force expressions.</p></body></html>
